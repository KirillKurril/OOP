# Long Backgammon
##### The project is an offline desktop version of the long backgammon game.
##### C# language and .NET Framework 8.0 are used for writing the underlying library of the game.
##### The library contains four classes: Game, GameBoard, Piece and Player, which implement the basic business logic of the application. Only the Game class is a public class. The interaction of the external part of the application with the internal abstractions is done through its methods. Below is the UML-diagram of the classes of the main application's library.

##### Unity will be used as the framework for creating the user interface.
##### If the tasks are successfully completed, PostgreSQL will be used in the next patches.
##### The project is developed by the second year student of the group 253504 Dmitruk Bogdan.
